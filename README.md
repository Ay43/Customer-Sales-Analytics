## Introduction:

Here is the report on the Power BI Challenge hosted by the Data Science Nigeria Community.


## Project Summary:

Temilola, the Client Engagement Manager, has just returned from a meeting where she received several data sets. The first provides client sales data, while the second comprises Regional, Product, and Client Budgets.

Temilola is currently searching for a report that analyzes these data sets and provides insight on the client behaviour.

As an analyst who collaborates closely with the customer service team i am to give an insight on the clients behaviour and find a way to present this data back to Temilola and the team.


## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to produce a report which summarizes all the data sets and provide an insight on the client behaviour.


## Steps;

>*Tool used is Power BI*


**Fetching the data:** The data was loaded into Power BI and was transformed for Cleaning.

**Data Cleaning:** The datasets provided had several empty column data and errors which were removed and also, several empty row data and errors were also discovered and were also removed while some were replaced with 0.

**Wrangling:** The 2 datasets provided were merged as new on Power BI to have just a single dataset for proper analysis and visualization. The datasets were merged on columns that share same entries.



## Insights
>*After Cleaning and Wrangling, the following are my analysis;*

From 2020 to 2021, The Total Sales orders made was 268k with Total Regional Budgets of 525.33m, Total Product Budgets of 1.29bn and Total Client budgets at 506.41m within these 2 years.

The bottom four (4) divisions comprises of East South Central, New England, West South Central and Mid Atlantic with sales orders of 23k,23k,14k and 12k respectively.

## Conclusions

From the datasets given and analysis conducted. It was observed that 2020 had the highest sales orders of 178k compared to 90k sales orders in 2021. This is a 49 % decrease in sales in 2021 which seems to be as a result of decrease in the budgets for the year 2021.

This means that the decrease in the budgets limited the business scope as some other factors of the business could not be touched or limited productions or distributions of the products.
